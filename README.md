Module 14

## Project Overview
This assignment focused on the Citibike use in NYC and the purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.


## Resources
Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv

Software: Tableau Public, Python 3.9.0, Anaconda Navigator 2.1.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6

## Results

#### Report
| Viz | Analysis |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="/Resources/img9.png"> | This graph shows the number of customers who use the bicycles and how long they use them. It can be seen that the service is used mostly by men and that most rentals of the bikes are for short periods of time. For reasons of future research, it is possible to select the gender and type of user |

These figures break down bike usage by day and hour. The darker colors represent higher usage and the lighter colors lower usage. It can be seen that the hours that bikes are used the most are when people is traveling to work/school at 8am and from work at 5 pm. A filter by type of user was added, which allows us to observe that subscribers use bikes mostly on workdays, while customers use bikes on weekends (perhaps because they are probably tourists).

| <img src="/Resources/img14.png"> | This graph breaks down bike usage by gender, weekday and hour. The darker colors represent higher usage and the lighter colors lower usage. It can also be seen from this graph that bikes are mostly used by men, however, regardless of gender, subscribers use the CitiBike service possibly to get to and from work/school. | 

From these visualizations it can be concluded that the best time to perform maintenance on bicycles is during the early hours of the morning (2am - 4am).

A map of New York City is shown in these visualizations and shows us the top starting locations and the top ending locations. We added a filter to select the gender and type of user, and using these filters it can be concluded that the bicycles are used the most by men. It can be seen that customers (possibly tourists) use the CitiBike service mostly in Central Park and near the Hudson River while subscribers while subscribers use it near the Empire State Building, Union Square and some subway stationsFrom these images it can be concluded that the analysis supports the hypothesis that subscribers use it mostly to go to work or school and that explains the short periods of use of the bikes.

## Summary

| Viz | Analysis |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="/Resources/img8.png"> | In these graph it can be seen that the majority of users are men and have a subscription service. Perhaps it would be convenient to apply a survey and see if women consider that riding a bike is not good in terms of safety or if it is because sometimes they wear clothes that are not suitable for riding a bike. |

As can be seen in the graph above, the CitiBikes service is used mostly by young adults between the ages of 23 and 33. We found it interesting to highlight that the records in the database that have an unknown gender are mostly clients who were born in 1969; Observing that this represents 8% of the total number of people who used the service, it would be interesting to investigate if the data entered by customers is reviewed.
